# data-representation-project
## This repository was created for a module called Data-Representation. 

It contains a main python file called application.py, a folder called static with a html file inside, a python file called ChristmasMoviesDAO.py, a text file called requirements.txt and a .gitignore file.

This project creates a basic Flask server that has a REST API which performs CRUD operations. It has a database table and an accompanying web interface which uses AJAX to call and to perform these CRUD operations. I chose to create a web interface on Christmas movies which allows a user to create a Christmas movie and add it to the table, as well as update the movies or delete them.
